    Homework for Chapter 1
-------------------------------
No chapter questions assigned this week.
Lucky...! Instead, your homework for this 
week is to make sure you have:

1) Java JDK 17+ Installed (With JavaFX)

2) Setting the Java HOME variable on your 
   respective OS (Windows/MacOS recommended)

3) Apache NetBeans 24 or 25 Installed and functioning.
   To check whether or not NetBeans is functioning,
   write out a HelloWorld test class, right-click
   within the "program window", and select the 
   dropdown option "Run File". (I'm pretty sure
   you can also use F5 to run the file.)
