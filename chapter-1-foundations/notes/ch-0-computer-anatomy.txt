There are some basic, extremely derived parts that are found
in every computer. Without knowledge of these, one may struggle
later on in this course.

PERIPHERALS: Hardware to extend the functionality of a computer.
             These are things like monitors, keyboards, computer
             mouses, headphones, speakers, et cetera.

SOFTWARE: Computer programs/sets of instructions.

HARDWARE: A computer or peripherals thereof.

(See section 1.2.2 in the book.)
INPUT UNIT --->  | The input unit, also referred to as "standard
                 | in", are things like the keyboard, a file, a
                 | program, etc. The book describes the input unit
                 | as the receiving part of a warehouse. It takes
                 | input. That's what it does.
                 |
OUTPUT UNIT ---> | The output unit, also referred to as "standard
                 | out", after the inputted information is processed,
                 | outputs the processed information. The book describes
                 | the output unit as as the shipping part of a warehouse.
                 | It gives output. That's what it does.
                 |
MEMORY UNIT ---> | The memory unit, commonly known to most computer
                 | people as RAM (Random Access Memory), is a low storage
                 | yet easy access memory location. The memory unit contains
                 | what is known as volatile memory, which is often lost
                 | when the computer shuts down. The book describes the
                 | memory unit as the warehouse. It allocates memory.
