Prior to beginning this course, you should have some basic
understanding of some OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) terms.

DATATYPE => There are many different kinds of datatypes to hold
			various different types of data. For example, an "int"
			datatype can hold whole numbers (24, 52, 70, etc), 
			while a "string" datatype can hold alphabetical data
			("Hello", "Gray Wave", "Java Time!", etc).

			In Java, there are many datatypes to choose from.
			Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. There are
			far too many to list here, but if you read the textbook,
			you will see what I mean.

CLASS   =>  A class is a way to store data as well as actions
			affiliated with that data. When speaking in OOP terms,
			we refer to the data as "Attributes", and the functions
			and/or actions as "Methods".

FUNCTION => A function is a way to store procedural logic in a
			conveniently modular way.
