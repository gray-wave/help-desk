<---     Note from Gray Wave     --->
This is just a general overview of different programming
languages that is covered in your textbook in chapter one.

In general, it is good to have a surface-level knowledge
of multiple programming languages, until you decide which
singular language you would like to get skilled in.

You should always be working on developing your computational
thinking skills.
