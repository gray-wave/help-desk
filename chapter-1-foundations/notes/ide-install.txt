       <=====     SUPER IMPORTANT     =====>

NOTE: DO NOT PERFORM/PROCEED WITH THESE INSTALLS UNTIL AFTER 
YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED THE CORRECT "JDK" (Java Development Kit).
THIS WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF HEADACHES LATER ON IN THIS COURSE.

          <=====     IMPORTANT     =====>

NOTE: IT IS HIGHLY NOT ADVISED TO USE ANY FORM OF GNU/LINUX
OPERATING SYSTEM FOR THIS COURSE. THE INSTALL PROCESS IS EVEN 
MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE STEP-BY-STEP PROCEDURES LAID OUT IN THIS
GUIDE. 
IF YOU NEED ACCESS TO A COMPUTER, AND/OR DO NOT OWN ONE, THE 
LIBRARY HAS COMPUTERS THAT YOU CAN SIGN INTO WITH YOUR SCHOOL 
E-MAIL.

With the warnings out of the way...

       >>>     UNDER CONSTRUCTION     <<<

For this course, it is required that you use
Apache NetBeans IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

I've found that NetBeans 24 works great on Windows 11
for this course.
