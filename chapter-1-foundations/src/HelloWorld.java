/* 
|  Here, we have the most simple Java program.
|  Java may look intimidating at first, but 
|  it's just rather time-consuming once you
|  get the hang of it.
|  
|  By convention, our class should have the
|  same name as the filename.
|  (See Line # 36) ----
|
|  This here that you are reading is what is 
|  known as a multi-line comment. It is prefaced
|  by a forward slash and an asterisk and
|  closed by an asterisk followed by a 
|  forward slash. The pipes to the left are
|  unnecessary, but I like to put them in
|  for a more easily readable format scheme.
|  (See Line # 1 and Line # 34) ----
|
|  Each Java program that executes must have
|  a "main" function, using the main keyword.
|  This is the "entry point" of our program.
|  (See Line # 37) ----
|
|  After the main function, we have our
|  procedural logic. Note that each line
|  within our function must end with a
|  semi-colon in order to compile properly.
|  (See Line # 38) ----
|
|  I suggest taking the time to write this out
|  on pen and paper until you can regurgitate
|  this syntax from memory.

public class HelloWorld{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
// Also, note that two forward slashes represent a single line and/or "in-line" comment.
