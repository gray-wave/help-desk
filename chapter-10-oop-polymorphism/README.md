# Order of Operations for Chapter 10 <br>

<h3>Steps for this Chapter</h3>
<p><b>Step 1) Read the assigned chapter.</b><br>
Should be second nature by now. Handwritten notes,<br>
practice, and test</p><br>
<p><b>Step 2) Attempt the Homework</b><br>
Remember, the course textbook and Javadoc<br>
are immensely helpful. Try to attempt the <br>
homework without any help from resources first.</p><br>
<p><b>Step 3) Check the Notes Directory</b><br>
Hopefully, these will be done in a timely<br>
manner. (narrator adds, "they weren't.")</p><br>
<p><b>Step 4) Check the Src Directory</b><br>
Contains commented source code that you can<br>
copy and run on your own machine.</p><br>
<p><b>Step 5) Javadoc is your Friend</b><br>
Refer to the Javadoc. Javadoc is awesome. <br>
I would also recommend searching Alex Lee.  <br>
He covers concepts in a clear and concise <br>
manner.</p><br>
