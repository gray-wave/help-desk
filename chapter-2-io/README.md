# Order of Operations for Chapter 2 <br>
<p>The order of operations serves as another <br>
guide to navigate this course. This will help <br>
decompose the homework, installs, et cetera into <br>
more easily digestible chunks.<br></p>

<h3>Steps for this Chapter</h3><br>
<p><b>Step 1) </b>Read the assigned chapter. This may <br>
seem obvious to some of you. Take handwritten notes if <br>
you care about retaining information. <br>
<br>
<b>Step 2) </b>Read the README for each chapter. I know, <br>
it's a lot of reading, but you took Java. It is time consuming. <br>
<br>
<b>Step 3) </b>Attempt the homework questions on your own <br>
before resorting to other resources. When you get stuck, <br>
check out the Java Docs in the "Docs" Folder. If you still <br>
find difficulty after consulting the JavaDocs, then...<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4) </b> Check out the other parts of the "Notes" <br>
Folder that are prefaced by the current chapter in the <br>
format "ch-X", where X is the number of the chapter. <br>
Anything preceded by "ch-0" is expected prior knowledge. <br>
<br>
<b>Step 5) </b> If you are still stuck after going <br>
through steps 1-4, check out the "Source" Folder (src) <br>
to view code written by yours, truly.</p><br>
