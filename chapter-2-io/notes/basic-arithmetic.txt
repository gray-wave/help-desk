(See Section 2.11 in the textbook)
In Java, we are capable of performing many different
mathematical operations. This chapter introduces the
basic arithmetic operators offered by Java. Later on
in this course, you will see that we are barely
scratching the surface of Java's math capabilities.

Operator     Name        Function
  "+"      Plus Sign     Adds two or more numbers
  "-"      Minus Sign    Subtracts two or more numbers
  "*"      Asterisk      Multiplies two or more numbers
  "/"      Fwd Slash     Divides two numbers
  "%"      Percent Sign  Referred to as "modulus" in programming,
                         the percent sign returns the remainder of
                         an "incomplete division" 
                         (EX: 22 / 7... 22 % 7 returns 1)
