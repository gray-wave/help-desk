(See Section 2.11 in the textbook)
In Java, we are capable of performing many different
mathematical operations. This chapter introduces the
basic arithmetic operators offered by Java. Later on
in this course, you will see that we are barely
scratching the surface of Java's math capabilities.
Java follows conventional orders of algebraic 
operations; you may have heard of this called
"PEMDAS" -> Parenthesis, then
            Exponents, then
            Multiplication, then
            Division, then
            Addition, then
            subtraction.

Operator       Name            Function
  "+"        Plus Sign         Adds two or more numbers
  "-"        Minus Sign        Subtracts two or more numbers
  "*"        Asterisk          Multiplies two or more numbers
  "/"        Fwd Slash         Divides two numbers
  "%"        Percent Sign      Referred to as "modulus" in programming,
                               the percent sign returns the remainder of
                               an "incomplete division" 
                               EX: 22 / 7... 22 % 7 returns 1

" ( "      Open parenthesis    You can use parenthesis to change the
" ) "      Close parenthesis   order of operations of an algebraic expression.
                               So, if you wanted to add prior to multiplying...
                               EX: ((3 + 2) * 3)... returns 15
                               3 + 2 * 3... returns 9.
