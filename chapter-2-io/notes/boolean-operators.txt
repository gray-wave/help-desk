(See Section 2.8 in the textbook)
In Java, we are capable of performing many different
boolean algebraic operations. This is fancy jargon
to state conditional logic, or you may already be
familiar with the concept of "Decision Structures".
There are only two possible outcomes with boolean
algebra; a condition can be a true statement or
a false statement. These operators are used in 
conjunction with if statements.

Operator         Name            Function
 " == "       Is equal to        Determines whether or not two
                                 variables hold the same value.
                                 If so, it will evaluate true.

 " != "       Not equal to       Determines whether or not two
                                 variables DO NOT hold the same
                                 value. If so, it will evaluate true.

 " > "        Greater than       Exclusive, if the left value is MORE
                                 than the right value, it will evaluate
                                 to true.

 " < "        Less than          Exclusive, if the left value is LESS
                                 than the right value, it will evaluate
                                 to true.

 " >= "       Greater than,      Inclusive, see "greater than".
              or equal to

 " <= "       Less than, or      Inclusive, see "less than".
              equal to

NOTE: A single equals sign is only used for variable assignment.
These mistakes can lead to failure to compile, or syntax errors that
eventually lead to logic errors.
