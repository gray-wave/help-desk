# Order of Operations for Chapter 3 <br>

<h3>Steps for this Chapter</h3>
<p><b>Step 1) </b>Read the assigned chapter. <br>
<br>
Take handwritten notes if you care about learning <br>
the course content or retaining information. <br>
<br>
<b>Step 2) </b>Read through notes/ directory. <br>
<br>
Notes directory contains some explanations and <br>
definitions that may help you through this chapter. <br>
<br>
<b>Step 3) </b>Attempt the Homework. <br>
<br>
If you get stuck, the JavaDocs may not be much help at this point. <br> 
So, re-read the notes/ directory. At this point, I'd recommend YouTube.<br>
If you are still stuck...<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4) </b>Check out the src/ directory. <br>
<br>
Once again, src/ directory contains commented code.<br>
This section introduces using multiple files in order <br>
to achieve a specific task.<br>
I'll admit, it's easy to get lost in a sea of many files.<br>
For this reason, we follow common naming conventions.<br>
