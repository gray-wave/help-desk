Today class, we will learn about encapsulation.

Data becomes "encapsulated" when we have the private scope
variable applied. That means it's trapped within the class.

The only way to access private variables is via these so-called
"set" and "get" methods. They are aptly named, as you are soon
to find.

Set methods take any number of arguments as parameters, and store
that information into an object... from my understanding.

As an example, let's say we have a class that is for employees.
We would need to set the employee name (as a string, but of course)
as well as their salary (as some numeric datatype).

So in our "class file," ... <==========

Get methods' sole purpose is to RETURN whatever data has been set.

Are these useful? Not necessarily. I figure set methods are more
useful than get methods, as get methods almost function similarly
to the ever-famous "debugging print".

The textbook has a great visual diagram of what I mean by 
"encapsulation".
