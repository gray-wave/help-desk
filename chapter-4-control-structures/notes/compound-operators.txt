Okay class,
today we are going to talk about compound operators. 

Java has ways of shortening certain operands such that
code can be more compact (not like an SUV), and more
easily read by the user/programmer/computer user. That's
us, in most cases.

+=
-=
*=
/=
%=

See figure 4.13 in the textbook for better explanations than I 
can offer you here.

These are good for repetition structures. See control-structures.txt
for more information.
