UNDER CONSTRUCTION AS OF 9/7/25
Okay class,

Today we are going to learn about control structures. 
Yippie!!! Hooray!!! 

What are control structures, you may find yourself asking yourself,
well, allow me to answer that burning question.

Control structures use boolean expressions (BOOLEAN RECALL: truth tables.)
to change what path or tree (or whatever the case may be) your program takes.

In python, you may recall using the keywords "if", "elif", and "else". It 
is very similar within Java, however, Java does NOT use "elif" as a keyword.

Instead, you must use the 'compound' (in quotes because this is not the proper
term for this.) keywords else + if.

Here's some example syntax of Java's super cool if statements.

double salary1;
double salary2;
double salary3;
// assume salary1 has been set to 12,000.35
// assume salary2 has been set to 65327.87
// assume salary3 has been set to 101,504.36
// also recall our encapsulation chat from last week.

if (salary <= 13000) {
  System.out.println("You are a member of the lower income tax bracket");
} else if (13000 < salary <= 67000) {
  System.out.println("You are a member of the middle income tax bracket");
} else {
  System.out.println("You are a member of the high income tax bracket"); // note that this else encompasses all cases above 67000. Why?
}

// I will have to check to see if this works, but I have homework to do.
// Good luck, fellow students.
