DUE 9/21/25

I'm starting to recognize a pattern that every other week
is a lot of problems. This week is a lighter week, so we
can relax a little bit after exam week.

The homework, should you choose to accept it, begins
on page 208 if you have the textbook in the syllabus.
Alternatively, the homework begins on page 260.
Alternatively, if you have procured a .pdf version of
the book, the homework begins on page 650.

The questions for this week are as follows (bear in mind
they are prefaced by chapter number and a period):

11,12,13,14,15,16,17,20,24,30

Good luck on your "homework mission."
