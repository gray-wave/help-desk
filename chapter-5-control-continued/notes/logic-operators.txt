We will talk about the many different logical operators
in this chapter. These boolean expressions result in a boolean true, 
or a boolean false. Recall that Booleans in Java are not
a numeric datatype, as they are in many other languages.

Other languages do 0s or 1s. Java literally does true/false.
This is a slight inefficiency as 8 bits are allocated for
an otherwise (in other languages) a 1 bit datatype. 

They are read/interpreted from left to right.
The order of operations is "NAO" (pronounced "now").
Not happens first " ! " 
And happens next  " & ", " && "
Or  happens last  " | ", " || "

The simplest logical operator to explain is the NOT
operator. The " ! " operator. Whatever boolean value,
you just take and flip.

The truth table is as follows:

        P    R
---------------------------
        0    1
        1    0

The " && " operator. It's the AND boolean expression. 
This can be thought of as the "if and only if" operator. 
Only if both boolean conditions are true, the "and logical expression"
will be true as well.

The truth table is as follows:

        P    Q    R
--------------------------
        0    0    0
        1    0    0
        0    1    0
        1    1    1

The next simplest to explain (and Gray-Wave's personal
favorite) is the " || " or operator. This is the OR boolean 
expression. This can be thought of as the "this or that"
operator. If one of two conditions is true, the "or logical
expression" will be true as well.

The truth table is as follows:

        P    Q    R
---------------------------
        0    0    0
        1    0    1
        0    1    1
        1    1    1

Now on to the more difficult boolean operators. The next
boolean operator we will talk about is the " ^ " operand.
This is the exclusive or operator, which performs an
XOR boolean expression. This results in a boolean true
if and only if "this" or "that." 

The truth table is as follows:

        P    Q    R
---------------------------
        0    0    0
        1    0    1
        0    1    1
        1    1    0

Lastly, the "&" and "|" boolean operands function 
identically to their corresponding 'doubled' counterpart,
except for the fact that they will always evaluate both
conditions. No short-circuit expression is the big
takeaway here.
