# Order of Operations for Chapter 6 <br>
<h4><b>UNDER CONSTRUCTION</b></h4><br>
<h3>Steps for this Chapter</h3>
<p><b>Step 1) </b>Read the assigned chapter. <br>
<br>
Take handwritten notes if you care about learning <br>
the course content or retaining information. <br>
<br>
<b>Step 2) </b>Read through notes/ directory. <br>
<br>
<strong>UNDER CONSTRUCT</strong><br>
<br>
<b>Step 3) </b>Attempt the Homework. <br>
<br>
Homework for this chapter is not going to be easy. We have<br>
many problems, as you're soon to find. 
<br>
<b>Step 4) </b>Check out the src/ directory. <br>
Unfortunately, I have a horrible habit of posting the<br>
contents of the source "src/" directory usually after the <br>
homework is due. This chapter, I'll do my best to get them <br>
posted before the weekend, but no guarantees.<br>
<br>
Once again, src/ directory contains commented code.<br>
This section introduces using multiple parameter methods. <br>
