obvious "under construction"

This weeks homework is gonna be a doozy. 
Your homework mission, should you choose to accept it
(which you definitely should), begins on page 251 if
you have the textbook from the syllabus. 

The questions are as follows (bear in mind they are
prefaced by the chapter number as well as a period):
8, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29,
30, 31, 32, 35.
