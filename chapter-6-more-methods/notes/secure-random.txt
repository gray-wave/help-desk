A few questions of this week's homework require the usage
of Java's SecureRandom() class. This file will attempt to 
be as clear and concise as possible.

In order to generate random numbers, you need to do 3 steps.

1) Import the class. This is done using the statement:

   import java.security.SecureRandom;

2) After that, we must instantiate an object of the class:

   SecureRandom [variableName] = new SecureRandom();
   
   Where variableName is any variableName of your choosing.

3) Assign the randomly generated number to a variable.

   [dataType] [variableName2] = [variableName].next[dataType]();
   
   Where dataType is whatever type of number (int, float, etc.),
   variableName2 is where the random number is stored,
   variableName is the same object of SecureRandom(),
   .next[dataType]() is the method to generate the random number.

class SecureRandom extends class Random... so it INHERITS all of Random's
attributes and methods ;)
