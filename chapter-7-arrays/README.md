# Order of Operations for Chapter n <br>

<h3>Steps for this Chapter</h3>
<br>
<p><b>Step 1)</b> Read the assigned chapter.</p><br>
<br>
Take handwritten notes, trust me. It actually helps.<br>
Don't have AI generate you examples.<br>
You will never learn that way, and the instantly <br>
gratifying nature of AI will literally <br>
make you less intelligent and slow you down.<br>
<br>
<p><b>Step 2)</b> Buckle up, buttercup.</p><br>
<br>
Arrays are a difficult datatype to learn to begin <br>
with, and in this chapter, they introduce both the <br>
standard array data types and the ArrayList objects. <br>
<i>Full disclosure</i>: this is the point where I gave up <br>
on a prior attempt at this course. After this point, I will <br>
be learning at the same pace as you all. <br>
<br>
<p><b>Step 3) </b>Read through the notes/ directory.</p><br>
<br> 
Once again, I can't guarantee I will have the notes/ or<br>
src directories done in a timely manner. Yeah, I'm one of <br>
<i>those</i> programmers. Besides, with how <i>"fake busy"</i> I am,<br>
you're lucky I am even still here.<br>
<br>
<p><b>Step 4)</b> Attempt the homework on your own.</p><br>
<br>
Should be pretty self-explanatory at this point. Javadoc will <br>
begin making more and more sense as the course progresses. <br>
It's a great resource, I don't know why I said previously that <br>
it wasn't. <br>
<br>
<p><b>Step 5)</b> If you get stuck...</p><br>
<br>
Office hours are posted in the syllabus. Also, you can <br>
bother me for "pair programming." Check the "Introductions" <br>
discussion board for where to find me. Sometimes, all you <br>
need is a second set of eyes... which is why I wear glasses. <br>
<br>
<p><b>Step 6)</b> If you get stuck (pt2)...</p><br>
<br>
Check out the src/ directory. Odds are I will not have it <br>
complete by the time the homework is due. <br>
