--- NOT DONE YET ---

So, to declare and initialize a 2-D array,
the programmer must specify in the array
declaration statement that the array object
has both rows and columns (x's and y's), like so:

int arr[][] = new int[#][#];

Where the hashtags("#")/pound signs/thing that
comes after c in c# represent the respective
number of rows and columns.

In order to access the elements of these rows
and columns, the programmer must use a nested repetition
structure. The inner loop (columns) should be bounded by 
the max number of rows (outer loop) that have been iterated
through.

Still haven't read Chapter 8, yet.
