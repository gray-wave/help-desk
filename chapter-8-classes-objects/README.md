# Order of Operations for Chapter 8 <br>

<h3>Steps for this Chapter</h3>
<p><b>Step 1) Read the assigned chapter</b><br>
Take handwritten notes if you care to. At this point,<br>
might just be worth your time to skip directly to the <br>
homework questions.</p><br>
<p><b>Step 2) Attempt the Homework</b><br>
Work through the problems. Don't forget the<br>
computational thinking that you have learned<br>
previously. Problem-solving strategies from prior<br>
languages apply here.</p><br>
<p><b>Step 3) Consult documentation.</b><br>
Javadoc is your friend. Javadoc definitely helps.</p><br>
<p><b>Step 4) Check the notes/ directory.</b><br>
I'm definitely not going to have the documentation
finished before the due date. Unfortunately, life
happens.</p><br>
<p><b>Step 5) Check the src/ directory</b><br>
Definitely not going to be done by Sunday,<br>
October 5th. Good luck.</p><br>
