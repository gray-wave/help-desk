Okay class. It's time to learn about BIG decimals.
And they are a BIG pain.

When you instantiate an object of class BigDecimal,
its "datatype" becomes that of a BigDecimal. So, instead
of being able to use standard, primitive type operations,
all of the mathematical operations must be performed with
methods of class BigDecimal.

This means you CANNOT use "+", "-", "*", "/", or "%".
This means you CANNOT use "<", ">", "<=", ">=", "!=", or "==".

Be extremely careful before you decide to promote a double
to a big integer.
