Chapter 8 expands on enum types.

An enum is a set of named constants. It shares
many similarities with classes in that it can
have attributes and methods... and that's where
I'll leave this for now.

[gray-wave note: i may have to fall back
 to sleep. this weekend is going to be
 nothing but work... ugh. gag me with a
 spoon. the trout population will be
 severely impacted. Gotta get back to
 Instagram reels until I fall asleep.]
