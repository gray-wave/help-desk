In Apache NetBeans IDE, a there are a couple of convenient
keyboard shortcuts that can save you precious time.

I believe I uploaded a .pdf containing a full list of
all NetBeans keyboard shortcuts in chapter-1-foundations.

psvm + TAB ===> public static void main(String[] args)
sout + TAB ===> System.out.println("");
