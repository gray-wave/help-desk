So, today class, we are going to discuss INHERITANCE.
This is an extremely important concept in object-oriented
programming. It is one of the four pillars of OOP...

Inheritance is the ability of a class to copy the 
behavior of another class. There is plenty of vocabulary
that comes along with this novel concept.

Superclass: A class that "donates" attributes and methods.
Subclass: The class that actually does the inheriting of
          pre-existing attributes and methods.
Base Class: Another name for a superclass, usually in a
          C++ context.
Derived Class: Another name for a subclass, usually in a
          C++ context.
Specialization: Another name for the concept of inheritance,
          the subclass exhibits behaviors of its superclass
          and can modify those behaviors to be more tailored
          to objects of the subclass.
