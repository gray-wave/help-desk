<b>Step 3) </b><br></p>
<h3>Steps for this Course</h3><br>
<p><b>Step 1) </b>Read the assigned chapter. This may <br>
seem obvious to some of you. Take handwritten notes if <br>
you care about retaining information. <br>
<br>
<b>Step 2) </b>Read the README for each chapter.</p><br>
<b>Step 3) </b>Attempt the homework questions on your own <br>
before resorting to other resources. When you get stuck, <br>
check out the Java Docs in the "Docs" Folder. If you still <br>
find difficulty after consulting the JavaDocs, then...<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4) </b> Check out the other parts of the "Notes" <br>
Folder that are prefaced by the current chapter in the <br>
format "ch-X", where X is the number of the chapter. <br>
Anything preceded by "ch-0" is expected prior knowledge.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 5) </b> If you are still stuck after going <br>
through steps 1-4, check out the "Source" Folder (src) <br>
to view code written by yours, truly.<br>
